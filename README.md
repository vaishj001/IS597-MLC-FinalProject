# IS597 MLC - Final Project

# Integrative Predictive Modeling of Diabetes Risk: Leveraging Health Indicators and Socio-Demographic Factors

## Vaishnavi Jayarama - vj15

## Project Overview
This project utilizes the *diabetes_012_health_indicators_BRFSS2015.csv* (Dataset) from the CDC Diabetes Health Indicators to develop machine learning models that predict the risk of diabetes. The project is split into two parts, each contained in separate Jupyter notebooks:

- **Part 1:** Focuses on binary classification for predicting 'no diabetes' vs. 'diabetes'.
- **Part 2:** Expands the prediction to include a multiclass classification system that adds 'pre-diabetes' as a transitional phase between 'no diabetes' and 'diabetes'.

The aim is to explore the relationship between sociodemographic characteristics and health indicators in predicting diabetes risk. We assess various machine learning models, analyze feature importance, and explore data segmentation to understand how different groups are affected by diabetes.

## Setup Instructions
To run these notebooks and replicate the project's findings, follow the steps below:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-github-username/IS597-MLC-FinalProject.git
   ```
   Replace `your-github-username` with your actual GitHub username.

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd diabetes-risk-prediction
   ```

3. **Install the required packages:**
   Mentioned at the top cells of both the Jupyter Notebooks.

4. **Launch Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   jupyter lab
   ```

5. **Open the Part 1 notebook for binary classification or the Part 2 notebook for multiclass classification. Execute the cells in sequence to view the analysis and results.**
